# Climate change-driven vulnerability 

The analytical framework is published as Chen et al., 2022 and Tang et al., 2025

The analyses are for Atlantic horseshoe crab 


## Prepare allele frequency 

Allele frequency is calculated with PLINK v1.9 for individuals of each sampling site using "--keep" and "--freq"

We then collect all the ".frq" files to generate a allele frequency table using the R script ("freq_cal.R") attached.

The output is "*.alfreq", which is to be used as input for gradientForest


## Prepare environmental variable 

We collect environment data from BIO-ORACLE and extract site variables using the R script ("geo_prep.R") attached.

The output is "*_env.csv", which is to be used as input for gradientForest


## Compute genotype-climate association with gradientForest 

We calculate genotype-climate association with a modified R script ("*_gradientforest.R") attached.

R script can output important vairants, three pdf files for PCA, transformed genotype-climate association across the distribution ranges and the genomic offset.


## Ecological niche modelling with MaxEnt

We modelled the niche suitability with MaxEnt v3.4.3 with 19 environmental variables. Output are .asc files. 

Change of niche suitability is calculated, visualized and output as .asc file with the R script ("diff_plot.R") 


## Calculation of genomic niche index (GNI)

We collected all the csv files of genomic offset (results of "*_gradientforest.R") and changes of niche suitability (results of "diff_plot.R") in one folder (set as working directory). 

Run the R script ("gni.R") to calculate, visualize and output GNI with multiple files of different formats (.csv, .asc and .pdf)  


## Landscape genetic analyses for the connectivity

We used R package resGF to compute resistance surfaces using gradient forest and allelic frequencies. See R script ("resDF_HSC.R").
